# Working-with-VPNs-task -8
Understanding the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication. This task develops hands-on skills in setting up a VPN, verifying secure browsing, and learning about the benefits &amp; limitations of VPNs.
************************************************************************************************************

## Tools Used  
- **ProtonVPN Free Tier (VPN Client)**  
- **Browser (for IP verification and website testing)**  
- **Website:** [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)  

## Methodology and Steps  

### Step 1: Choose a Free VPN Service & Sign Up  
- Selected **ProtonVPN Free Plan**.  
- Signed up with email, username, and password.  
- Verified account via email confirmation.  

---

### Step 2: Download and Install the VPN Client  
- Downloaded ProtonVPN client from the [official site](https://protonvpn.com/download).  
- Installed on Windows 10/11.  
- Launched the application and logged in with credentials.  

---

### Step 3: Connect to a VPN Server  
- Opened ProtonVPN app.  
- Selected a **Free Server** (closest available location).  
- Clicked **Connect** → Connection established successfully.

---

### Step 4: Verify IP Address Change  
- Opened [WhatIsMyIPAddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
- Confirmed that the **IP address and location** changed to the VPN server’s location.  

*Screenshot:* Browser window showing new IP & location.

---

### Step 5: Browse a Website to Confirm Encryption  
- Visited [https://example.com](https://Youtube.com).  
- Website loaded normally → traffic confirmed as encrypted.  

---

### Step 6: Disconnect VPN and Compare  
- Disconnected from ProtonVPN.  
- Checked IP again on [WhatIsMyIPAddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
- Observed return to **real IP address and location**.  
- Compared browsing speed → noticed slightly faster speeds without VPN.  

*Screenshot:* Browser showing real IP after disconnect.

---

### Step 7: Research VPN Encryption and Privacy Features  
- ProtonVPN uses **AES-256 encryption** and protocols like **OpenVPN/IKEv2**.  
- Ensures secure tunneling between client and VPN server.  
- Protects against **ISP monitoring, MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks, and geo-restrictions**.  

---

### Step 8: Summary of VPN Benefits and Limitations  

#### ✅ Benefits  
- **Privacy Protection:** Masks real IP and location.  
- **Secure Communication:** Encrypts all traffic.  
- **Safe Public Wi-Fi Use:** Prevents attackers from stealing data.  
- **Bypass Geo-Restrictions:** Access content not available in your region.  
- **Stops ISP Tracking:** Prevents monitoring of browsing activity.  

#### ⚠️ Limitations  
- **Reduced Speed:** Due to encryption and rerouting.  
- **Free VPN Restrictions:** Limited servers and speed.  
- **Not Absolute Anonymity:** Provider policies may log activity.  
- **Blocked by Some Sites:** Streaming and banking may restrict VPN usage.  
- **Battery Impact (Mobile):** Higher usage due to encryption processing.
